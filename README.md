- Intra-individual reaction time variability in the incompatible (conflict) flanker task condition
- Intra-individual reaction time variability in the compatible (no conflict) flanker task condition
- Differential incompatible-compatible RT scores (also referred to as "conflict effect scores")
- Mean RT in the incompatible flanker task condition
- Mean RT in the compatible flanker task condition
- Mean accuracy in the incompatible flanker task condition
- Mean accuracy in the compatible flanker task condition

All outcomes were analyzed with mixed models in R. 

The dataset used in the analysis script is the file named "EFT_dataset.csv".
